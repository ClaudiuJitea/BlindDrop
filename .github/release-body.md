BlindDrop is an arena FPS in one C file. No engine, no asset files: maps, weapons and sounds are all generated in code.

This build has no telemetry, no update check and no built-in server. It only uses the network when you join or host a multiplayer game.

**Linux:** download `blinddrop-linux-amd64`, then:

```sh
chmod +x ./blinddrop-linux-amd64
./blinddrop-linux-amd64
```

Needs an x86_64 system with glibc 2.38 or newer: Ubuntu 23.10+, Debian 13+, Fedora 39+, Arch or SteamOS 3.7+.

Check your download with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.

A Windows build is not available yet.
